This project aims to This project aims to develop a Live MIDI Performance & Visualization System that combines real-time MIDI music generation from a computer keyboard or MIDI controller with a dynamic visualizer for live performances, DJ sets, or interactive music shows.

Users will be able to play MIDI notes using a standard keyboard, generate loops and beats, and see real-time animations that respond to the music. The visualizations will be synchronized with MIDI input, making it a useful tool for electronic musicians, DJs, and VJs (visual jockeys).
