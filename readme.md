This is a project for CSC575/CSC475.

The goal of this project is to develop an 8-bit style music sequencer that allows users to generate 8-bit music using only mouse clicks. Additionally, it integrates pixel art with 8-bit music, creating a visually and sonically cohesive experience.

We leverage square wave generation based on Music Information Retrieval (MIR) concepts and apply different envelopes to produce various styles of 8-bit music.
